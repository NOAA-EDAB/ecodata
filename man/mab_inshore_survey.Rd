\description{
These data are aggregated time series of inshore fishery-independent trawl survey data from the Mid-Atlantic Bight.
Surveys are performed biannually in the spring and fall months as part of the Northeast Area Monitoring and
Assessment Program (NEAMAP), covering the inshore region between Cape Cod, MA and Cape Hatteras, NC. Cooperative survey
efforts are led by scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.
}
\details{
Stratified mean biomass (kg/tow) was calculated by:
\enumerate{
\item Species catch weights were summed for each tow and within each feeding guild.
\item Average weight per tow with associated variances and standard deviation for each
year/season/stratum/feeding guild combination was calculated.
\item The final index was then calculated as the sum of the weighted averages of the strata, where the
weight of a given stratum was the proportion of the survey area accounted for by that
stratum (i.e., stratum area/survey area).
