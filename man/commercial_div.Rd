\description{
These data are time series of diversity metrics for commercial fisheries in the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem, and
were drawn from a blend of VTR trip data, CFDBS prices, vessel characteristics from PERMIT databases,
and major VTR gear by permit. Here "MA" and "NE" refer to the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions respectively, and are
not derived by Ecological Production Unit.
