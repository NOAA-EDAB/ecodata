\description{
Estimated zooplankton abundance anomaly on the Northeast US Continental Shelf
used in the regime shift analysis.
}
\details{
These data were derived from bimonthly Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) cruises throughout the Northeast US Continental Shelf,
and represent a different estimation method than what is found in the zooplankton anomaly data set. Specifically, abundance
anomalies were interpolated following an ordinary kriging approach by season across the Northeast Shelf Ecosystem. Exact methods
used to derived these data are available at \url{https://noaa-edab.github.io/ECSA/}.
