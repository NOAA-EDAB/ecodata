Recreational fishing indicators derived from Marine Recreational Information Program data queries.
}
\details{
There are five indicator time series within this data set: recreational effort (number of days fished),
recreational seafood (number of fish caught), recreational anglers (number of anglers), diversity of recreational
catch (effective Shannon index), and recreational fleet effort diversity across modes (effective Shannon index).

More information about each of these indicators is available at
