\itemize{
\item Var: Common name of surveyed species. If data reflect the aggregated shelf-wide anomaly, then \code{NE LME} is included with the species name.
\item EPU: EPU where sampling occurred.
\item Time: Year.
\item Value: Small fish per large fish biomass anomaly.
\item Units: Units of variable \code{Var}.
