#' @details
#' NOAA Fisheriesâ€™ Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs) were developed using
#' secondary data including social, demographic and fisheries variables. The social and
#' demographic data were downloaded from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-yr
#' estimates Dataset at the U.S. Census American FactFinder site for coastal communities
#' at the Census Designated Place (CDP) level, and in some cases the County Subdivision
#' (MCD) level. Commercial fisheries data were pulled from the Commercial fisheries database (CFDBS).
#' The recreational fishing information is publicly accessible through the Marine Recreational Information
#' Program (MRIP). More information including processing and indicator derivation steps are available at
