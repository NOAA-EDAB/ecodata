## Overview

`ecodata` is an R data package developed by the Ecosystems Dynamics and Assessment Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center
for use in State of the Ecosystem (SOE) reporting. SOE reports are high-level overviews of ecosystem indicator status and trends occurring
on the Northeast Continental Shelf. Unless otherwise stated, data are representative of specific Ecological Production Units (EPUs), referring to 
the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB), Georges Bank (GB), Gulf of Maine (GOM), and Scotian Shelf (SS). SOE reports are developed for US Fishery
Management Councils (FMCs), and therefore indicator data for Scotian Shelf are included when available, but this is not always the case. 

### Please consult the [technical documentation](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/) of SOE indicators before using data sets.
