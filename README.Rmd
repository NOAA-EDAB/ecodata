## Overview

`ecodata` is an R data package developed by the Ecosystems Dynamics and Assessment Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center
for use in State of the Ecosystem (SOE) reporting. SOE reports are high-level overviews of ecosystem indicator status and trends occurring
on the Northeast Continental Shelf. Unless otherwise stated, data are representative of specific Ecological Production Units (EPUs), referring to 
the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB), Georges Bank (GB), Gulf of Maine (GOM), and Scotian Shelf (SS). SOE reports are developed for US Fishery
Management Councils (FMCs), and therefore indicator data for Scotian Shelf are included when available, but this is not always the case. 

### Please consult the [technical documentation](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/) of SOE indicators before using data sets.

## State of the Ecosystem cycle

The main branch of this repository contains the data used in the most recently published [State of the Ecosystem](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/state-ecosystem-reports-northeast-us-shelf) reports (Mid Atlantic and New England reports). Data for use in the following years report can be found on the `dev` branch of the repository. Once the reports are written and the cycle ends this data will be pulled into the main branch and [released](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/releases)

## Installation

For the last released complete data set

```{r, eval = F}
remotes::install_github("noaa-edab/ecodata",build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

For data used in the current developing cycle

```{r, eval = F}
remotes::install_github("noaa-edab/ecodata@dev",build_vignettes=TRUE)
```


## Loading data sets
